## Project Description
  This project is a single player game. Upon starting you are prompted to choose how many players (robots) you would like to play against. Each player is given 1000 chips to start. The main player will be asked if they would like to wager or fold for each round. In addition to this, console prompts are printed each round to show game statistics and information for development use only. The game operates like a traditional poker game until one player remains or the main player runs out of chips.
